Cantata started off as a fork of QtMPC, mainly to provide better KDE
integration - by using KDE libraries/classes wherever possible. However, the
code (and user interface) is now *very* different to that of QtMPC, and both
KDE and Qt (Linux) builds have the same feature set. Also, as of 1.4.0, by
default Cantata is built as a Qt-only application (with no KDE dependencies)
