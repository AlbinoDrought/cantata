Cantata started off as a fork of QtMPC, however, the code (and user interface)
is now *very* different to that of QtMPC.

Downloads
=========

Curently I'm developing v2.0, and as such the older 1.x is no longer actively
maintained (the code base is *very* different). However, these older versions
may still be downloaded from [Cantata's github wiki](https://github.com/CDrummond/cantata/wiki/Previous-%28Google-Code%29-Downloads)
